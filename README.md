## What I've learned

### - Communication with external API's

With the project I nedded to get data from the twitter official API and the OpenCageMap API, this way, I needed to study them from their documentations in order to get all the informations the way I wanted, always with the correct format.

### - OAuth

I needed to get the twitter authentication, so I needed to study the Twitter documentation in order to get information about the authentication flow that they use.

### - Session in NodeJS

The OAuth1.0 from Twitter only works with sessions in Node, this way, I needed to get information on how to implement it on my backend.
